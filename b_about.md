### Nice to meet you!   

I am a PhD candidate in computer science at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal,
Brazil.    
   
My current research interests are related to empirical studies in Software Engineering. In
particular, I have been doing research about the delays that new functionalities and new features
suffer before being integrated into new software releases. I have also evaluated bug-detection
techniques along my PhD course.   
   
Besides research, I like bodybuilding, games, and, especially meeting new people. Feel free to send
me a message!
