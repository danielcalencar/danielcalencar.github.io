I am looking for passionate students (both masters' and PhD) to perform
exciting research in the Software Engineering field. My current projects
involve the development of supporting (and inteligent) tools that will considerably
improve the software development processes in software companies. 

My supervision philosophy is to be committed with you and bring the best of
your potential. I encourage you to contact any of my previous students (listed
below) in case you are curious about how it is to work with me. 

* [João Helis Bernardo](https://github.com/joaohelis) (PhD candidate)
* [Gustavo Sizilio](https://github.com/gustavosizilio) (PhD candidate)
* [Edmilson Campos](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edmilson_Neto) (PhD)
* [Guoliang Zhao](http://post.queensu.ca/~zouy/people.html) (PhD candidate)
* [Taher Ahmed Ghaleb](https://taher-ghaleb.github.io/) (PhD candidate)
* [Mariam El Mezouar](http://post.queensu.ca/~zouy/people_data.html) (PhD candidate)
* [Yu Zhao](http://post.queensu.ca/~zouy/people_data.html) (PhD candidate)
* [Ehsan Noei](http://noei.net/) (PhD)
* Possibly you?

The academic career in Software Engineering is very rewarding as it allows you
to use your own creativity to tackle real and important problems. Don't hesitate to
contact me if you are interested in performing research in Software Engineering. You
get a bonus point if you already have a cool research idea.
