### Do you want to upgrade your academic career?

You are in the right place. I am currently hiring new master's and Ph.D.
students to perform exciting research in the Software Engineering field. 
The academic career is very exciting as it allows you to travel around the world
once you start publishing your research work! 

I am glad to supervise both kiwi (a.k.a new zealander) and international
students.

My supervision philosophy is to bring the best of your potential. If you are
interested in starting a master's or Ph.D, please leave me an e-mail.
